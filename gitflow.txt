Hey Michael

just playing around with gitflow

So heres what I found out:

You start with git flow init.....then it askes you for the names but the defaults are cool as we want a dev branch

then when you start a feature you go:

  git flow feature start <featurename>

  then when you are ready to share:

  git flow feature publish <featurename>

  when you are ready to merge the branch and are finnished :

    git flow feature finish <featurename>

    the thing is it actualy deletes the branch when its merges it into the dev branch. which I think is a bit of a bummer.
